# 🗨️ C# Console Chatbot

Welcome to the **C# Console Chatbot**!  
This project is a simple but powerful chatbot you can run in your terminal. It supports two modes:

- **Offline Mode (rules)** → replies using a set of built-in rules (math, time/date, jokes, etc.).
- **LLM Mode (AI)** → connects to a real AI model through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for natural conversation.
